  Hey there! Feel free to contact us, We will be glad to answer your questions and help you out.

The name, *Pchas*, comes from a word in gilaki language,  'پیچا' pronounced like picha, it means cat. since we are a team we used it in plural and since there is no 'I' in a team we removed 'i' from it (Actually we removed i because of domain name.).
